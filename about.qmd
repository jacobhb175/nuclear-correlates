About this site:


I am a sophomore majoring in International Relations at New York University. You can contact me or view my work at my [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobhb175) or jacob.hardin.bernhardt@nyu.edu.

This project, which is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobhb175/nuclear-correlates), attempts to evaluate the influence of nuclear proliferation on restraint in interstate conflicts through analysis of data from the Correlates of War Project.

This project was created as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
