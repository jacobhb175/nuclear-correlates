My data draws on the Militarized Interstate Disputes version 5.0 dataset from the Correlates of War Project (https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/mids/). To clean and present the data, I used R and RStudio, ChatGPT, and libraries and functions including tidyverse, scales, and ggplot. To create a model based on the data, I used libraries including tidybayes and gtsummary.
